```

### 3. Configuration Settings
Rename the environment file in the client side.
```bash
    Rename .env.local1 to .env.local
```

### 4. Setting up the frontend
Open a new terminal in VS Code and run the following commands to install the required packages and start the frontend

```bash
    cd Client
    npm install   # install the required packages
    npm run dev
```
Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 to access the frontend of the application.

### 5. Setting up the backend
